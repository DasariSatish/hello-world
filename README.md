# hello-world

Let me tell you my story,

When I get old, I will not regret about the things that I've done. I will regret the things that I havenâ€˜t done in my life.

I truly believe in "Spheres Of Influence" -  "to truly live an extraordinary life,you must strive to reach and influence as many people as deeply and as profoundly as you possible can."

Since then I have done my best to do exactly that.I have sought to mentor and lead where appropriate.I have tried to make sure the work I created was always the kind that I was proud of; the kind that helps others pursue their own goals.
